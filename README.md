Impulses generated by an infrared sensor detecting the revolutions of a ferraris 
disk based power meter are published via MQTT and also displayed on a simple
embedded web page. As visual feedback the blue LED on the Wemos D1 mini board will
blink if the red marker has been detected. Meter values are frequently saved
to EEPROM to migate counter resets due to possible intermediate power failures.

## Shopping list

* [Wemos D1 mini](https://arduino-projekte.info/wemos-d1-mini/) development board
* [TCRT5000](https://www.google.com/search?q=TCRT5000) IR sensor board
* 5V (250mA) Power supply with micro USB plug

## Using the TCRT5000's analog output (A0) instead of D0

Since the low/high impulses generated by the widely used TCRT5000 sensor on D0 are
not very reliable (e.g. multiple counts for single pass of the "red marker" on
the ferraris disk) its analog output (A0) is used to automatically determine a
suitable threshold value to detect the marker. This way you don't need to fiddle
with the small potentiometer on the sensor board to find the "right" trigger 
threshold for your specific sensor mouting setup.

## Compiling the firmware for the Wemos D1 mini

Set the `WIFI_` and `MQTT_` defines at the beginning of the sketch. The value for
`TURNS_PER_KWH` must match the value printed somewhere on your ferraris meter!
Uncomment `LANGUAGE_EN` for an english web UI and serial debug messages.

[Add support for ESP8266 based boards](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) to 
your Arduino IDE using the boards manager.

Before trying to compile and flashing the sketch to the `Wemos D1 R1` board make 
sure that the following libraries have been installed using the 
[Arduino IDE library manager](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries):

* [EPS8266Wifi](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/ESP8266WiFi)
* [ESP8266WebServer](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/ESP8266WebServer)
* [ESP8266HTTPUpdateServer](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/ESP8266HTTPUpdateServer)
* [PubSubClient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient/releases)
* [EEPROM_Rotate](https://github.com/xoseperez/eeprom_rotate)

## Hardware Schematics

</p>

Connect the 5V pin of the TCRT5000 sensor to 3.3V pin (not 5V!) of the Wemos 
board and its ground pin to GND. The analog output of the TCRT5000 sensor (A0)
must be connected to the corresponding analog input (A0) of the Wemos. The Wemos 
can be powered with a small USB power supply (5V, around 250mA).

## Initial operation

After powering up the Wemos D1 mini it should connect to your Wifi network and
receive an IP via DHCP (check your router or the serial debugging messages).
Point your favourite browser to the IP. If you see the embebbed web page you
can proceed mounting the sensor and the Wemos on your ferraris meter.

## Mounting the sensor on the ferraris meter
 
For mounting the TCRT5000 on your ferraris meter a little 3D printed case
comes in handy. Thingiverse offers quite a few options like this one: 
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2668168

Since this sketch also supports OTA-Updates of the firmware, you only need to flash 
your ESP8266 once before mounting in your meter cabinet.

## Setting the threshold to detect the red marker

Make sure that during the initial calibration phase of `READINGS_TOTAL_SEC` to
determine a suitable analog threshold value the ferraris disk is actually turning
fast enough. The calculation of the threshold should be based on at least two
full revolutions with the red marker passing the IR sensor. Turning on your oven
should help to speed up things... ;-)

## Optional debug readings with InfluxDB and Grafana

For debugging purposes you can continuously send the analog readings to an 
[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview/) via UDP. 
Contiously visualizing the readings with [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/)
might help placing the TCRT5000 on your power meter to get better IR readings.
